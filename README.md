# Why Cypress?

## In a nutshell

Cypress is a next generation front end testing tool built for the modern web. We address the key pain points developers and QA engineers face when testing modern applications.

We make it possible to:

- Set up tests
- Write tests
- Run tests
- Debug Tests

Cypress is most often compared to Selenium; however Cypress is both fundamentally and architecturally different. Cypress is not constrained by the same restrictions as Selenium.

This enables you to write faster, easier and more reliable tests.

## Who uses Cypress?

Our users are typically developers or QA engineers building web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks.

Cypress enables you to write all types of tests:

- End-to-end tests
- Component tests
- Integration tests
- Unit tests
- Cypress can test anything that runs in a browser.

### Run the Cypress Script Test

- run `npm install` to install all the cypress dependencies
- `npm run cypress:run` for running the tests specs directly
- `npm run cypress:open` for opening the cypress dashboard panel
